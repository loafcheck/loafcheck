## 👋 &nbsp;Hey there!

### 👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

🌎💻👥 &nbsp; I’m an aspiring software developer with experience managing multiple ventures.<br/> 
I enjoy seeing how technology can connect individuals, revitalize communities, and benefit the world.<br/>
In my business role, I had the opportunity to connect young designers with older textile factory owners <br/>
who were technologically inexperienced. This project showed how technology <br/> 
can rejuvenate overlooked generations and foster relationships with young professionals. <br/>
My commitment to forming bonds was also reflected in my job as an educator. <br/>
I developed the FLIP project to address the limitations of existing language games, <br/>
significantly enhancing student engagement as well as creating a more enjoyable learning experience.<br/>

These experiences demonstrated how technology creates connections and drives positive change, <br/>
leading me to pursue a full-time career in tech. <br/> 
After completing a six-month Front-end Developer Certification at Likelion, <br/>
I am determined to be a catalyst for connecting people, generations, and communities!<br/>
