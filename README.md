## 👋 &nbsp;Hey there!

### 👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

🌎💻👥 &nbsp; I’m an aspiring software developer with experience managing multiple ventures. I enjoy seeing how technology can connect individuals, revitalize communities, and benefit the world. In my business role, I had the opportunity to connect young designers with older textile factory owners who were technologically inexperienced. This project showed how technology can rejuvenate overlooked generations and foster relationships with young professionals. My commitment to forming bonds was also reflected in my job as an educator. I developed the FLIP project to address the limitations of existing language games, significantly enhancing student engagement as well as creating a more enjoyable learning experience.

These experiences demonstrated how technology creates connections and drives positive change, leading me to pursue a full-time career in tech. After completing a six-month Front-end Developer Certification at Likelion, I am determined to be a catalyst for connecting people, generations, and communities!
